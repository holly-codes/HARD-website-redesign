              <br/>
			  <p>HARD will be starting a new cohort of our rookie program in early 2020 - dates will be posted soon, so keep your eyes peeled! Whether you've been interested in trying roller derby for a long time or just a few minutes, we've got a place for you.</p>
			  <p>Our rookie program will teach you everything you need to know to be the best and safest roller derby player that you can be. Whether you've got tons of skating experience or have never put on a pair of skates, there is a place for you in our rookie program. We will teach you all of the skills you need, from the ground up - even if you have never stood up on skates before, or are more like Bambi on ice than a seasoned roller skater.</p>
			  <p>Intimidated? Nervous? That's okay! At HARD, we pride ourselves on being a friendly, welcoming, and inclusive league, and strive to provide a fun and safe place for all of our skaters, from the newest rookie to the most seasoned veteran.</p>
			  <h4>What You'll Need</h4>
			  <p>You'll need to bring:
				  <ul>
					  <li>Your own, pre-formed mouthguard. Many of our skaters recommend SISU mouthguards, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SISU-Guards-Custom-Sports-Mouthguard/dp/B01LX2DYI1">available on Amazon</a>.</li>
					  <li>Proof of medical insurance. To skate with us, you'll need to prove that you've got your own, valid medical insurance. We want to make sure that you're safe! And, our insurance requires it of us.</li>
					  <li>Plenty of drinking water. You'll want to be sure to stay hydrated!</li>
					  <li>Comfortable clothes. We'll be doing a lot of active things during the course of each session of our rookie program, so you'll need comfortable activewear-type clothing.</li>
					  <li>Protective gear, if you already have it. If not, no worries! We've got some that you can borrow.</li>
					  <li>Skates, if you've got them. If not, again, no worries! We have some that you can borrow.</li>
					  <li>A positive attitude! Come have a good time with us. We'd love to teach you all about our favorite sport.</li>
				  </ul>
			  </p>
			  <h4>What We'll Provide</h4>
			  <p>We'll provide you with:
				  <ul>
					 <li>Rental skates to borrow. They're not the most flashy of skates, and they're not derby-specific, but they'll get you up on 8 wheels and learning some basic skills.</li>
					 <li>Protective gear to borrow - except a mouthguard (which you'll need to bring with you, for sanitary reasons). We'll lend you a helmet, knee pads, wrist guards, and elbow pads while you're on skates.</li>
					 <li>A fun, empowering experience that will help you feel more awesome and powerful than you've felt in a long time.</li>
					 <li>Camaraderie with your fellow rookies like nothing you've ever experienced!</li>
				  </ul>
			  </p>

				<h3 class="major">Officials (Skating and Non-Skating)</h3>

We are always looking for help from both skating and non-skating officials alike to ensure that our bouts and scrimmages run like a well-oiled machine.
